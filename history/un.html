				<!-- Explanation start -->
				<p id="big-font">The Security Council (UNSC) is an organ of the UN which is responsible for maintaining peace and security across the world</p>
				<div class="list">
				<p>It consists of 15 countries:</p>
				<p>5 of these countries are "permanent" members</p>
					<ul class="perm-countries-un">
						<li>Russia <img width="70px" src="images/russia.jpeg"></li>
						<li>USA <img width="70px" src="images/usa.jpeg"></li>
						<li>United Kingdom <img width="70px" src="images/uk.jpeg"></li>
						<li>China <img width="70px" src="images/china.jpeg"></li>
						<li>France <img width="70px" src="images/france.jpeg"></li>
					</ul>
				<p>These countries have <b>Veto powers</b>, which means they can reject any resolution regardless of the other countries' opinions
				"
				<br>If any of the permanent countries leave, <b>the UN is likely to collapse</b></p><br><br>
				<p>The other 10 countries are "not-permanent" and are elected by the General Assembly (another organ of the UN) for 2-year-terms.<br>As of 2024, the 10 elected countries are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Albania</li>
					<li>Brazi</li>
					<li>Gabon</li>
					<li>Ghana</li>
					<li>India</li>
					<li>Ireland</li>

				<h2 style="margin-top: 3px;" id="centered">Creation of the UNSC</h2>
				<p>The United Nations Security Council was established as one of the principal organs of the United Nations by the UN Charter, which was adopted on June 25, 1945, in San Francisco at the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on International Organization. <!-- The creation of the UNSC was a result of the recognition of the need to maintain peace and security in the aftermath of World War II. --></p>
				<p>Some more points about the creation of the UNSC are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The devastation caused by World War II, including the loss of millions of lives and widespread destruction, created the urgent need for a collective security mechanism to prevent such catastrophic conflicts in the future. The creation of the UNSC was a response to these historical events.</li>
					<li>The 5 permanent members with veto powers where chosen by if they played important role in WW2</li>
					<li>There were 5 countries chosen because the UN aimed to ensure a balance of power and prevent any single country from dominating the Council</li>
				</ol>

				<div class="div-three">
				<h2 style="margin-top: 3px;" id="centered">How does the UNSC maintain peace?</h2>
				<p>The Security Council can achieve peace and security through various means:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Peacekeeping Operations:</b> It can authorise peacekeeping missions to be sent to conflict zones to help stabilize situations and facilitate political processes (basically sending in soldiers)</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Sanctions:</b> It can impose sanctions on countries or entities that threaten international peace and security, aiming to pressure them into compliance with UN resolutions.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Conflict Resolution:</b> The UNSC can address conflicts and disputes between nations through diplomatic efforts, negotiations, and mediation aiming to resolve the disputes peacefully.</li>
					<br>
					
					<li><b>Military Action:</b> In extreme cases, the Security Council can authorize military action, sending a whole army, to address threats.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 style="margin-top: 3px;" id="centered">The UNSC today</h2>
				<p>To the present day, the Security Council has done many things to maintain global peace and security for which it is either respected or critisized.</p>
				<p>Here are some examples that happened not too long ago:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>North Korea's Nuclear Program:</b>
						<ul><li>The UNSC has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. These sanctions aimed to pressure North Korea to comply with international non-proliferation norms.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Iran Nuclear Deal:</b>
						<ul><li>The UNSC played a crucial role in endorsing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), aka the Iran nuclear deal, in 2015. The agreement aimed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.</li></ul>
					<li>And... <b>The Covid-19 pandemic:</b>
						<ul><li>The UNSC has held meetings to discuss the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for international cooperation, equal vaccine distribution, and support for poor countries.</li></ul>
				</ul>

				<h4 style="margin: 0px;" id="centered">Finally...</h4>
				<h2 style="margin: 3px;" id="centered">Criticism of sanctions on North Korea</h2>
				<p>
					In recent years, the international community, led by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), has resorted to imposing sanctions on North Korea in an attempt to curb its nuclear weapons program. However, a closer examination of these sanctions reveals a complex web of challenges and unintended consequences.<br><br>

The primary goal of sanctions is to pressure North Korea into abandoning its nuclear ambitions. Yet, despite the imposition of various economic, trade, and financial sanctions, North Korea has not taken a step back from its pursuit of nuclear weapons, conducting multiple nuclear tests and advancing its missile capabilities. This raises serious questions about the effectiveness of sanctions as a tool for achieving disarmament objectives.<br><br>

Moreover, the humanitarian impact of sanctions cannot be ignored. The sanctions have contributed to severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential goods in North Korea, affecting ordinary citizens who are already vulnerable to the regime's oppressive policies, rather than targeting the regime.<br><br>

Furthemore, there have been instances of lax enforcement and illicit trades occurring outside the bounds of international law. Despite concerted efforts to restrict North Korea's access to international markets and resources, reports have surfaced indicating clandestine trade networks and smuggling operations that circumvent sanctions measures. These illicit activities enable North Korea to evade the intended economic pressure and continue its nuclear proliferation efforts. These trades have also supplied North Korea with the resources for missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>

To conclude, while the imposition of sanctions on North Korea may have been intended as a method of exerting pressure on the regime, their effectiveness remains questionable.
